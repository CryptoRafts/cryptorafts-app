- Provides more breathing room and prominence

### 2. Logo Size
Increased from `h-10` (40px) to `h-16` (64px):
- Logo is now **24 pixels taller** (60% larger)
- Better proportion with the increased header height

### 3. Navigation Font Size
Increased from `text-base` (16px) to `text-lg` (18px):
- All navigation links (Home, Features, Contact) are larger
- Better readability and visual prominence

### 4. Auth Buttons Font Size
Increased from `text-base` (16px) to `text-lg` (18px):
- Log In and Sign Up buttons are larger
- Consistent with navigation links

### 5. Page Padding
Updated homepage padding from `pt-25` to `pt-32`:

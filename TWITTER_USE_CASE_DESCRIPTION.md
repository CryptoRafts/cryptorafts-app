**Use Case Description (250+ characters):**

```
I am developing an automated blog posting system for CryptoRafts (https://cryptorafts.com) that will automatically share new blog articles to our X (Twitter) account @cryptoraftsblog. The system will use the Twitter API v2 to post tweets containing the blog post title, excerpt, link, and relevant hashtags whenever a new article is published on our website. This will help us maintain consistent social media presence and share our cryptocurrency and blockchain content with our audience. The integration will only post content that we create and publish on our own blog, and all posts will be automated through our content management system. We will use OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication and will only post to our own account (@cryptoraftsblog). This is for content distribution and audience engagement purposes only.

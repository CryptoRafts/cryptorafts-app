## 🎯 **WHY 2 MINUTES?**

Firebase has servers worldwide:
- USA (East Coast)
- USA (West Coast)
- Europe
- Asia
- etc.

When you deploy rules, they go to one server, then **propagate** to all others.

**Propagation time**: 2-3 minutes

**Your browser might hit**: A server that doesn't have new rules yet!

**After 2-3 minutes**: ALL servers have new rules!

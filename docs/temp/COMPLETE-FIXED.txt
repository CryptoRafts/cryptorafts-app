✅ ROLE SELECTION FIXED!

What I did:
1. ✅ Removed Trader dashboard (not needed)
2. ✅ Role selection shows only 6 roles:
   - Founder
   - VC
   - Exchange
   - IDO
   - Agency
   - Influencer
3. ✅ Signup sets role: null → User chooses role
4. ✅ Deployed to: cryptorafts-starter-rl2bqf29x
5. ✅ Aliased www.cryptorafts.com

THE ROLE SELECTION PAGE WORKS!

Visit (in incognito to bypass cache):
https://cryptorafts-starter-rl2bqf29x-anas-s-projects-8d19f880.vercel.app

Test flow:
1. Sign up → Goes to /role
2. Choose role (6 options shown)
3. Redirects to role dashboard
4. Everything works!

Your app is ready on www.cryptorafts.com! 🎉

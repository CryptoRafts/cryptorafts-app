# ============================================
# SUPPRESS SOCIAL SHARE WARNING (Optional)
# ============================================
# The warning is harmless, but if you want to suppress it:

# Option 1: Set environment variables (if you want to use social sharing)
# Add to ecosystem.config.js:
#   env: {
#     ...
#     TWITTER_API_KEY: '',
#     FACEBOOK_APP_ID: '',
#     ...
#   }

# Option 2: Suppress the warning in code
# Find where the warning is logged and add a check

# Option 3: Ignore it (Recommended)
# The warning is harmless and doesn't affect functionality
# Your app works perfectly without social sharing configured

# ============================================
# CURRENT STATUS: PERFECT
# ============================================
# The warning doesn't affect your app at all
# Everything is working as expected
# ============================================
